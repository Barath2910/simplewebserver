# Developing a Simple Webserver
## AIM:
To develop a simple webserver to display about top five programming languages.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1: 
HTML content creation
### Step 2:
Design of webserver workflow
### Step 3:
Implementation using Python code
### Step 4:
Serving the HTML pages.
### Step 5:
Testing the webserver

## PROGRAM:
```
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
content = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My webserver</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Top five programming languages</h1>
<h2>Java</h2>
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
<h2>C++</h2>
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.
<h2>Python</h2>
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
<h2>PHP</h2>
PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere.
<h2>Typescript</h2>
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. ... TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node. js or Deno).

class myhandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        print("request received")
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('content-type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(content.encode())
server_address = ('',8080)
httpd = HTTPServer(server_address,myhandler)
print("my webserver is running...")
httpd.serve_forever()
```
## OUTPUT:
### Client Side Output

## RESULT:
Thus, a simple webserver is developed to display top five programming languages.
